ClusterControl Cookbook
=======================

Installs ClusterControl for your new database node/cluster deployment or on top of your existing database node/cluster. ClusterControl is a management and automation software for database clusters. It helps deploy, monitor, manage and scale your database node/cluster.

Supported database clusters:

- Galera Cluster for MySQL
- Percona XtraDB Cluster
- MariaDB Galera Cluster
- MySQL Replication (master-slave and master-master)
- MySQL Group Replication
- MySQL single instance
- MySQL Cluster (NDB)
- MongoDB Replica Set
- MongoDB Sharded Cluster
- PostgreSQL Streaming Replication

Details at [Severalnines](http://www.severalnines.com/clustercontrol) website.

This cookbook is a replacement for the deprecated [cmon](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/cmon) cookbook that we have built earlier. It manages and configures ClusterControl and all of its components:

- Install ClusterControl controller, cmonapi and UI via Severalnines package repository.
- Install and configure MySQL, create CMON DB, grant cmon user and configure DB for ClusterControl UI.
- Install and configure Apache, check permission and install SSL.

Requirements
------------

### Platform

- CentOS, Redhat, Fedora
- Debian, Ubuntu
- x86\_64 architecture only

Tested on Chef Server 11.1/12.0 on following platforms (x86\_64 only):

- CentOS 6.5
- CentOS 7
- Ubuntu 12.04
- Ubuntu 14.04
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Debian 7
- Debian 8

Make sure you meet following criteria prior to the deployment:

- ClusterControl node must run on a clean dedicated host with internet connection.
- If you want to add an existing cluster, ensure your database cluster is up and running.
- If you are running as sudo user, make sure the user is able to escalate to root with sudo command.
- SELinux/AppArmor must be turned off. Services or ports to be enabled are listed [here](http://www.severalnines.com/docs/clustercontrol-administration-guide/administration/securing-clustercontrol).


Attributes
----------

Please refer to `attributes/default.rb`

Data Bags
---------

Data items are used by the ClusterControl controller recipe to configure SSH public key on database hosts, grants cmon database user and setting up CMON configuration file. We provide a helper script located under `clustercontrol/files/default/s9s_helper.sh`. Please run this script prior to the deployment.

### Helper script - s9s_helper.sh
```bash
$ cd ~/chef-repo/cookbooks/clustercontrol/files/default
$ ./s9s_helper.sh
```

Answer all the questions and at the end of the wizard, it will generate a data bag file called `config.json` and a set of command that you can use to create and upload the data bag. If you run the script for the first time, it will ask to re-upload the cookbook since it contains a newly generated SSH key:
```bash
$ knife cookbook upload clustercontrol
```

### Example data bag - clustercontrol/files/default/config.json
```json
{
  "id"                      : "config",
  "cmon_password"           : "cmonP4ss",
  "mysql_root_password"     : "myR00tP4ssword",
  "clustercontrol_api_token": "b7e515255db703c659677a66c4a17952515dbaf5"
}
```

*We highly recommend you to use encrypted data bag since it contains confidential information*

### ClusterControl general options

Following options are used for the general ClusterControl set up:

`id`
The data item identifier. Do not change this value.

`cmon_password`
Specify the MySQL password for user cmon. The recipe will grant this user with specified password, and is required by ClusterControl.
- Default: 'cmon'

`mysql_root_password`
Specify the MySQL root password. This recipe will install a fresh MySQL server and it will create a MySQL user.
- Default: 'password'

`clustercontrol_api_token`
40-character ClusterControl token generated from s9s\_helper script.
- Example: 'b7e515255db703c659677a66c4a17952515dbaf5'


Usage
-----
#### clustercontrol::default, clustercontrol::controller

For ClusterControl host, just include `clustercontrol` or `clustercontrol::controller` in your node's `run_list`:

```json
{
  "name":"clustercontrol_node",
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[clustercontrol]"
  ]
}
```

** Do not forget to generate databag before the deployment begins! Once the cookbook is applied to all nodes, open ClusterControl web UI at `https://[ClusterControl IP address]/clustercontrol` and create the default admin user with valid email address.
